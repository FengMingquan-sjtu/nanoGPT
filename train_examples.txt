• Process the student answer as a Math Object Formula, and break down its parse tree by its top-level operators.  The idea is to create an array of the student’s primitive factors, so say 3(x+1)(x+2)ˆ2 gives (3,x+1,x+2). • Because  we may want factoring over Z, checking the gcd of coefficients within each factor. • Pass each of these things to  SAGE and ask if the nonconstant factors are reducible over Z or Q. Also ask if they are monic. These things at  least we learned how to do at the Vancouver code camp. The end goal is to count the following forms as correct,  possibly controlled by flags: n \{}prod (factor)ˆpower, where each factor is irreducible in Z[X], n in Z r \{}prod  (factor)ˆpower, where each factor is irreducible and monic in Q[X], r in Q I suppose on the last one the monic  requirement could be dropped with a flag. I have no plans to check that the form is fully condensed, e.g. forcing  (x+1)ˆ2 and rejecting (x+1)(1+x)
The equation of the path traversed by a projectile is called equation of trajectory. \n \n Suppose, the body reaches  the point P after time ( t ) . \n \n Horizontal motion has no acceleration. Thus, using kinematic equation, horizontal  distance covered will be – \n \n x = u \cos \theta t \n \n Or, \quad t = ( \frac { x }{ u \cos \theta } ) \n \n Vertical  motion has constant acceleration ( g ) . Thus, distance covered will be – \n \n y = ( u \sin \theta ) t - \left ( \frac  {1}{2} \right ) g tˆ2 \n \n = ( u \sin \theta ) \left ( \frac {x}{u \cos \theta} \right ) - \left ( \frac {1}{2} \right ) g \left (  \frac {x}{u \cos \theta} \right )ˆ2 \n \n = \left ( \tan \theta \right ) x - \left ( \frac {g}{2 uˆ2 \cosˆ2 \theta} \right ) xˆ2  \n \n In this equation, ( \theta, \ u \ \text {and} \ g ) are constants. Thus, \n \n 1. Term \left ( \tan \theta \right ) is a  constant, let it is ( p ) \n 2. Term \left [ \left ( \frac {g}{2 uˆ2 \cosˆ2 \theta} \right ) \right ] is also a constant, let it is  ( q ) \n \n So, \quad y = p x - q xˆ2 \n \n Therefore, ( y \propto xˆ2 ) , which is a required condition of a parabola.  
The trajectory of the projectile is a parabola. \n \n ### Time of Maximum height \n \n As the body is projected it  goes up. Vertical component of velocity ( u \sin \theta ) gradually diminishes and becomes zero at the maximum  height of flight. After that, body starts moving downwards. \n \n Let, ( t_m ) is the time to reach at maximum  height ( h_m ) of flight. \n \n Therefore, from kinematic equation, we have – \n \n 0 = u \sin \theta - g t_m \n \n Or,  \quad t_m = \left ( \frac {u \sin \theta}{g} \right ) \n \n ### Time of Flight \n \n Total time taken by the projectile  between the instant it is projected and till it reaches at a point in the horizontal plane of its projection is called Time  of flight. \n \n Let, the body reaches at point B on ground after time ( T_f ) of projection. Then – \n \n Net vertical  displacement covered during the time of flight is zero. Using kinematic equation of motion, we get – \n \n 0 = ( u  \sin \theta ) T_f - \left ( \frac {1}{2} \right ) g \ ( T_f )ˆ2 \n \n Or, \quad T_f = \left ( \frac {2 u \sin \theta}{g} \right  ) = 2 \left ( \frac {u \sin \theta}{g} \right ) \n \n = 2 t_m \n \n Thus, \quad \text {Total time of flight} = \text {Time  of ascent} + \text {Time of descent} \n \n = 2 \times \text {Time of maximum height.} \n \n ### Maximum height  of Flight \n \n It is the maximum height reached by a projectile. It is denoted by ( h_m ) \n \n At the highest point  of flight, the vertical component of velocity becomes zero. \n \n From kinematic equation of motion, we have – \n  \n vˆ2 = uˆ2 + 2 a s \n \n Therefore, \quad 0ˆ2 - ( u \sin \theta )ˆ2 = 2 ( - g ) h_m \n \n Or, \quad h_m = \left ( \frac  {uˆ2 \sinˆ2 \theta}{2 g} \right )  
We identify two equations having the same solution with the equivalence relation: \n \n $(a,b) \sim (c,d) \mbox{ if  and only if } ad = bc$ \n \n To show that this is an equivalence relation: \n \n 1. Reflexivity: $$(a,b) \sim (a,b)$$ if  and only if $$ab = ba$$ which is true. Hence it is reflexive. \n 2. Symmetry: $$(a,b) \sim (c,d)$$ if and only if  $$ad = bc$$ if and only if $$bc = ad$$ if and only if $$(c,d) \sim (a,b)$$. Hence it is symmetric. \n 3. Transitivity:  $$(a,b) \sim (c,d)$$ and $$(c,d) \sim (e,f)$$ if and only if $$ad = bc$$ and $$cf = de$$. Multiplying these equations  together, we get $$adcf = bcde$$. We can cancel $$d$$ and $$c$$ from both sides to get $$af = be$$. Hence  $$(a,b) \sim (e,f)$$. \n \n Hence, we have successfully formed the set of rational numbers when we factor out  the equivalence classes! \n \n $\mathbb{Q} = \frac{\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\}}{\sim}$ \n  \n Let’s now take a look at what members of $$\mathbb{Q}$$ look like, say for the equation $$2x = 3$$. This  equation is represented by the ordered pair  
If the light moves in a purely radial direction, we can describe its path by the coordinate functions $$t(\lambda)$$ and  $$r(\lambda)$$. The equation of motion $$dsˆ2 =0$$ then takes the form $$g_{tt} \left(\frac{dt}{d\lambda}\right)ˆ2  + g_{rr} \left(\frac{dr}{d\lambda}\right)ˆ2 = 0,$$ which we can rewrite as $$\left(\frac{dt}{dr}\right)ˆ2 = \frac{g_{rr}}{g_{tt}}.$$ \n \n The length of the rod is then $$L = c \int_{r_1}ˆ{r_2} \frac{dt}{dr} \text{ d}r = c  \int_{r_1}ˆ{r_2} \sqrt{-\frac{g_{rr}}{g_{tt}}} \text{ d}r,$$ where I have taken the positive square root because  $$r_2 > r_1$$. \n \n Notice that the length is independent of the signature of the metric, so whether you work with  the (-+++) or (+—) metric is purely conventional and will not change the physics. \n \n For the Schwarzschild  metric, we obtain explicitly $$L = r_2 - r_1 + r_s \ln\left(\frac{r_2 - r_s}{r_1 - r_s}\right) > r_2 - r_1.$$ \n \n Now  what happens if you magically, instantaneously increase the mass of the black hole? I think the length $$L$$ of the  rod stays the same (I’m here assuming that the rod is infinitely stiff), but that it would now ”appear shorter” to the  distant observer - i.e. it would no longer occupy the entire space between $$r_1$$ and $$r_2$$.
